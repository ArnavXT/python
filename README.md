Hey there! ðŸ˜„ I made a Wordle-inspired game in Python where you get to guess a secret word within a set number of tries. Every time you make a guess, Iâ€™ll give you cluesâ€”like which letters are correct and in the right spotâ€”to help you crack the code! ðŸ§© It's all about using your vocab and logic to get the answer before your guesses run out. Give it a go if you're up for the challenge! ðŸŽ‰
